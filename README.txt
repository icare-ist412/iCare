---------- This Submission's Details: ---------------------------

This submission is for Use Case 2: View Immunization History. 

There are two views: Staff and Patient (login info below) both 
offering separate experiences for the user, with Staff having
more functionality. 

The "View Medical Record" and "My Medical Record" buttons are 
both disabled purposely while under development for the next
deliverable.

The following refactors were implemented as per last week's
refactoring plan:

David
 - Simplified new user input form validation in AddUserViewController.
    More specifically, in the validateUserInput() method.
 - Simplified authentication method in LoginViewController.
    More specifically, in the performAuth() method.
